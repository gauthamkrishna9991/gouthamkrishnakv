# Hi there!

I'm **Goutham Krishna K V**.

I'm some guy who just loves to code, and read fiction, and love to also play
video-games. I presently build Rust/Rocket Back-end RESTful Servers.

I also love and use **`C/C++`** (Along with **`Make`**, **`CMake`** and
**`Meson`**), **`Java`** (w/ **`Gradle`** / **`Maven`**), **`Javascript`** /
**`Typescript`** (w/ **`npm`**, **`Vue`** Front-end, **`Express`** etc.) and
**`Python 3`** (w/ **`setuptools`**/**`twine`**/ PyPI stuff). I'm one of those
kind of people who think framework knowledge and the ecosystem is more important
rather than a programming language.

Oh and _Linux_ too, with a hopefully good-enough RPM Packaging, which I
personally use for my Fedora COPR Repos [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/gauthamkrishna9991/).

but most of all, samy is my hero.
